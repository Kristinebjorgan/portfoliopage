      "Can Ronin serve as a blueprint for future blockchain gaming platforms?",
    description: "This case study explores the Ronin blockchain as a purpose-built solution for play-to-earn gaming, examining how its architecture addresses critical issues of scalability, cost-efficiency, and user empowerment. Using Axie Infinity as a central example, the paper breaks down Ronin’s technological innovations—from consensus mechanisms to the Ronin Bridge—and evaluates its potential as a blueprint for future Web3 gaming platforms. It also critically assesses Ronin’s vulnerabilities, adaptability, and the wider implications for decentralization in digital economies.",

      "How can we better facilitate the use of knowledge acquired through project work?",
    description: " This study explores how organizations can better preserve and utilize the knowledge gained through project work, with a particular focus on tacit knowledge and experiential learning. Through theoretical frameworks, academic research, and a qualitative interview, it highlights the importance of reflection, culture, and practical tools in facilitating meaningful learning across projects. The paper argues that prioritizing learning alongside time, cost, and quality is essential for long-term success and innovation.",
