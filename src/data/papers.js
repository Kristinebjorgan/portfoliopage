    title: "Exploring the Ronin blockchain",
    subtitle:
      "Can Ronin serve as a blueprint for future blockchain gaming platforms?",
    description:
      "This case study explores the Ronin blockchain as a purpose-built solution for play-to-earn gaming, examining how its architecture addresses critical issues of scalability, cost-efficiency, and user empowerment. Using Axie Infinity as a central example, the paper breaks down Ronin’s technological innovations—from consensus mechanisms to the Ronin Bridge—and evaluates its potential as a blueprint for future Web3 gaming platforms. It also critically assesses Ronin’s vulnerabilities, adaptability, and the wider implications for decentralization in digital economies.",

    title: "Conserving knowledge",
    subtitle:
      "How can we better facilitate the use of knowledge acquired through project work?",
    description:
      " This study explores how organizations can better preserve and utilize the knowledge gained through project work, with a particular focus on tacit knowledge and experiential learning. Through theoretical frameworks, academic research, and a qualitative interview, it highlights the importance of reflection, culture, and practical tools in facilitating meaningful learning across projects. The paper argues that prioritizing learning alongside time, cost, and quality is essential for long-term success and innovation.",

          "Kandidaten leverer en svært solid del 1 med Gantt-skjema, milepælsplan med ansvarskart og resultatløp og et fint prosjektmandat. En svært spennende problemstilling som burde være mye mer sentral i all prosjektarbeid. Kandidaten leverer en svært god og teoretisk velfundert del 2. Kanskje blir det vel mye fokus på teori framfor konkrete eksempler som demonstrerer praktisk anvendelse av teori, men et godt og relevant intervju trekker opp. I sum er dette en velskrevet og grundig besvarelse som dokumenterer modenhet og god faglig innsikt. Men studenten kunne ha skilt enda tydeligere mellom hva som er gjennomgang/presentasjon av fagstoff, hva som er funn/resultater/data, og hva som er konkret oppsummering/konklusjon/anbefalinger. Studenten hadde tjent på å følge malen for eksamen på en klarere måte. Stor grad av selvstendighet og svært god vurderingsevne. Forbilledlig føring av kilder og referanser og en enorm referanseliste.",

          "The candidate delivers a very solid Part 1 with a Gantt chart, milestone plan with responsibility chart, result timeline, and a strong project mandate. A very interesting problem statement that should have been much more central throughout all projectwork. The candidate delivers a very good and theoretically well-founded Part 2. Maybe there's a bit too much focus on theory rather than concrete examples that demonstrate practical application of theory, but a good and relevant interview lifts it. Overall, this is a well-written and thorough submission that demonstrates maturity and strong academic insight. However, the student could have more clearly distinguished between what is a review/presentation of subject material, what are findings/results/data, and what is a summary/conclusion/recommendations. The student would have benefited from following the exam template more clearly. High level of independence and very good judgment. Exemplary citation and referencing, and an extensive reference list.",
